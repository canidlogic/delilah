   * The scene object array.
   * 
   * Only available if m_loaded.
   * 
   * This is a Uint16Array with (n * 5) elements, where n is in the
   * range [1, 65535].  Each five elements define a 3D object in the
   * scene, as described below.  Object n starts at index (n * 5), where
   * object zero is the first object in the array.
   * 
   * The five 16-bit words have the following meaning:
   * 
   *   1 : vertex index of first vertex
   *   2 : vertex index of second vertex, or 0xffff if point
   *   3 : vertex index of third vertex, or 0xffff if point or line
   *   4 : fill color if triangle, else ignored
   *   5 : style (see below)
   * 
   * The object can be a point (one vertex), a line (two vertices), or a
   * triangle (three vertices).
   * 
   * The fill color for triangles is in 15-bit HiColor format with most
   * significant bit zero, as follows:
   * 
   *   MSB ----------- LSB
   *   0rrr rrgg gggb bbbb
   * 
   * For point objects, the style is an index into the point style
   * array.
   * 
   * For line objects, the style is an index into the line style array.
   * 
   * For triangle objects, the style encodes three five-bit selectors
   * and the most significant bit is zero, as follows:
   * 
   *   MSB ----------- LSB
   *   0iii iijj jjjk kkkk
   * 
   * Each selector is either zero, or it is one greater than the index
   * of style in the line style array.  This allows each selector to
   * select either one of the first 31 styles in the line style array,
   * or the special value of zero.
   * 
   * The first selector is for the triangle edge between the first and
   * second vertices.  The second selector is for the triangle edge
   * between the second and third vertices.  The third selector is for
   * the triangle edge between the third and first vertices.  If the
   * selector is zero, the edge will not be specially rendered.
   * Otherwise, the edge will be rendered using the selected line style.

  /*
   * The painting sort array.
   * 
   * Only available if m_loaded.
   * 
   * This is a Uint32Array with (n / 5) elements, where n is the number
   * of elements in m_scene.  During a rendering operation, after vertex
   * transformation, scene objects that survive the backface cull and
   * full near/far plane clipping will be entered into this array.  Once
   * all the surviving objects are entered into this array, the array
   * will be sorted so that objects will be rendered back to front
   * according to the painter's algorithm.
   * 
   * Each 32-bit integer stores a Z value in its most significant 16
   * bits and an object index in its least significant 16 bits.  The
   * object index is an index into the m_scene array, or it has the
   * special value 0xffff, which means this array element is not used.
   * All array elements that are not used are given the value 0xffffffff
   * so that they are sorted at the end of the list.
   * 
   * The Z value is quantized so that zero is the far clipping plane and
   * 0xffff is the near clipping plane.  This means that when the array
   * is sorted in ascending numerical order, the farthest objects from
   * the camera come first.

   * 
   *   "size"   : float   - edge length of bounding box
   *

   * 
   * The stroke width must either be 0.0 or a value greater than 0.0.
